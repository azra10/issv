Software Issue Manager enables development teams to document, analyze, track and prioritize projects and issues.

== Description ==
Software Issue Manager(SIM) is a project based bug, issue, task and product feature request tracking system with extensive built-in and custom reporting capabilities. [Premium editions](https://emdplugins.com/plugin_tag/sim-com/) are available.

If you need ticket management system, try our [WP Ticket plugin.](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-ticket/)

= Why we developed this plugin =

We, Emarket Design, believe that one of the most important factors affecting production of quality products is having a strong requirement management and analysis process. Most projects fail because organizations do not spend enough time on this stage of the project life cycle. By developing a family of products primarily designed for software issue management, we wanted to meet the needs of like-minded organizations as well as ours and do our share of promoting importance of requirement management and analysis process.

= Concepts =

Issues are the items you would like to track in your projects. Issues could be tasks, feature requests, bugs or pretty much any thing you need related to your projects.

SIM Projects are identified by a name and a version number. Projects may have unlimited number of issues. Issues can be shared by multiple projects. You can create manual issues from the admin backend by setting the author.

All Software Issue Manager editions support open, closed or mixed projects/issues. Frontend login and registration forms are available.

The SIM community edition uses built-in roles:
* Admins can access all
